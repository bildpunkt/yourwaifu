# waifuimg

All images yourwaifu will post

# File Rules

* Images MUST be safe for work (SFW)
* Not too big images, they get compressed anyway
* Only the character which is _the waifu_ should be shown or in main focus
* Used filetype for the images is PNG, always.

# Image Order

* Images are always ordered like this: `series/name.png`, the only exception is the Fate series, which is ordered like `Fate/subseries/name.png`
